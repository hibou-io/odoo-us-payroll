===
Use
===

In general, the base module (l10n_us_hr_payroll) should form the basis for a 'US Employee' Salary Structure (that would be the
parent of a state specific Salary Structure if need be). This module provides all of the Salary Rules (calculations), registers,
and Partners (e.g. EFTPS).

The secondary module (l10n_us_hr_payroll_account) is a very basic mapping between the stock Odoo US Chart of Accounts and the
various Salary Rules from above. These mappings are very generic and probably not appropriate for general use, and is meant for
testing or inspiration. (Odoo's Chart of Accounts lacks specific accounts for things like `Employee Net Payable`, and I suggest
that you create your own!)
